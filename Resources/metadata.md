# Metadata Recommendations

We acknowledge the reality that individual processing archivists may not have the authority to apply all of the methods described here. The following recommendations include those that are actionable in the day-to-day process of descriptive work, as well as those that require advocating for and implementing broader institutional changes at an administrative level. We encourage readers to take action where they can.<sup>[5](#myfootnote5)</sup>

<a name="myfootnote5">[5]</a> Thank you to Dorothy Berry for encouraging us to consider the difference between guidelines, recommendations, and manifestos, as well as the power required to implement institutional change. 

## Voice and Style

* Unlearn the “neutral” voice of traditional archival description.<sup>6</sup> Rather than striving for an “objective” voice, which reinforces existing power structures, base description in the question (as posed by Michelle Caswell and Marika Cifor): “Is the descriptive language I am using respectful to the larger communities of people invested in this record?”<sup>7</sup> Decenter “neutrality” and “objectivity” in favor of “respect” and “care.”<sup>8</sup>
* Avoid passive voice (or passive language in linked data predicates<sup>9</sup>) when describing oppressive relationships. Use active voice in order to embed responsibility within description. For example, consider the difference between these two sentences: 
 * “Four Kent State University students were killed on May 4, 1970, during a clash between the Ohio National Guard and a crowd gathered to protest the Vietnam War.”
 * “Members of the Ohio National Guard killed four Kent State University students during a mass protest against the Vietnam War.”

* Focus on the humanity of an individual before their identity/ies: 
  * For example, consider the difference between “documents the business dealings of a Black woman named Maria in 18th century Mexico” and “documents the business dealings of Maria, a Black woman in 18th century Mexico.”<sup>10</sup>
* Refrain from writing flowery, valorizing biographical notes for collection creators.<sup>11</sup> Evaluate existing biographical notes, especially those describing white males, for aggrandizing language and remove it.<sup>12</sup>
* Remove and refrain from including evaluative terms like “preeminent,” “renowned,” “genius,” or “seminal” that serve to praise collection creators. Ask yourself: Does including this piece of  information help users better understand the collection, or is it there only to justify the collection creator’s stature?
  * Excerpt from a “what not to do” example: “In addition to his work as a lawyer, Hays wrote an astounding number of books and articles. As a gifted writer and eloquent debater, he added his perspective to virtually every individual rights issue of his day. His autobiography, entitled City Lawyer: the Autobiography of a Law Practice (1942), provides a colorful account of his more noteworthy cases, and his articles and book reviews demonstrate his wide-ranging knowledge of a nation and a world experiencing dramatic change in the way individual rights were perceived.”<sup>13</sup>
* Use accurate and strong language such as lynching, rape, murder, and hate mail when they are appropriate. Do not let your discomfort with the terms censor the material. It is okay to be uncomfortable with racist material. It is not okay to privilege your discomfort above accurate description.
* Describe relationships of power when they are important for understanding the context of records. Racism, slurs, white supremacy, colonialism, and histories of oppression are important context.
  * For example, “Thomas Jefferson was a known enslaver despite his legacy as a supporter of individual rights.”
