# Metadata Recommendations

We acknowledge the reality that individual processing archivists may not have the authority to apply all of the methods described here. The following recommendations include those that are actionable in the day-to-day process of descriptive work, as well as those that require advocating for and implementing broader institutional changes at an administrative level. We encourage readers to take action where they can.<sup>[5](#myfootnote5)</sup>

<a name="myfootnote5">[5]</a> Thank you to Dorothy Berry for encouraging us to consider the difference between guidelines, recommendations, and manifestos, as well as the power required to implement institutional change. 

## Voice and Style

* Unlearn the “neutral” voice of traditional archival description.<sup>[6](#myfootnote6)</sup> Rather than striving for an “objective” voice, which reinforces existing power structures, base description in the question (as posed by Michelle Caswell and Marika Cifor): “Is the descriptive language I am using respectful to the larger communities of people invested in this record?”<sup>[7](#myfootnote7)</sup> Decenter “neutrality” and “objectivity” in favor of “respect” and “care.”<sup>[8](#myfootnote8)</sup>
* Avoid passive voice (or passive language in linked data predicates<sup>[9](#myfootnote9)</sup>) when describing oppressive relationships. Use active voice in order to embed responsibility within description. For example, consider the difference between these two sentences: 
  * “Four Kent State University students were killed on May 4, 1970, during a clash between the Ohio National Guard and a crowd gathered to protest the Vietnam War.”
  * “Members of the Ohio National Guard killed four Kent State University students during a mass protest against the Vietnam War.”

* Focus on the humanity of an individual before their identity/ies: 
  * For example, consider the difference between “documents the business dealings of a Black woman named Maria in 18th century Mexico” and “documents the business dealings of Maria, a Black woman in 18th century Mexico.”<sup>[10](#myfootnote10)</sup>
* Refrain from writing flowery, valorizing biographical notes for collection creators.<sup>[11](#myfootnote11)</sup> Evaluate existing biographical notes, especially those describing white males, for aggrandizing language and remove it.<sup>[12](#myfootnote12)</sup>
* Remove and refrain from including evaluative terms like “preeminent,” “renowned,” “genius,” or “seminal” that serve to praise collection creators. Ask yourself: Does including this piece of  information help users better understand the collection, or is it there only to justify the collection creator’s stature?
  * Excerpt from a “what not to do” example: “In addition to his work as a lawyer, Hays wrote an astounding number of books and articles. As a gifted writer and eloquent debater, he added his perspective to virtually every individual rights issue of his day. His autobiography, entitled City Lawyer: the Autobiography of a Law Practice (1942), provides a colorful account of his more noteworthy cases, and his articles and book reviews demonstrate his wide-ranging knowledge of a nation and a world experiencing dramatic change in the way individual rights were perceived.”<sup>[13](#myfootnote13)</sup>
* Use accurate and strong language such as lynching, rape, murder, and hate mail when they are appropriate. Do not let your discomfort with the terms censor the material. It is okay to be uncomfortable with racist material. It is not okay to privilege your discomfort above accurate description.
* Describe relationships of power when they are important for understanding the context of records. Racism, slurs, white supremacy, colonialism, and histories of oppression are important context.
  * For example, “Thomas Jefferson was a known enslaver despite his legacy as a supporter of individual rights.”

## Community Collaboration and Expanding Audiences

Expand the range of audiences considered when writing archival description to include a plurality of audiences. Evaluate local descriptive practices and policies using the criteria: Which audiences does this description center? Which audiences does it exclude?

* For academic archives, this could look like making description more comprehensible for undergraduates, genealogists/family historians, and local community members. For archives collecting Spanish-language material, this could mean considering whether English-language finding aids are serving users. This could also look like minimizing archival jargon.

* For academic archives, reach out to institutional scholars who have expertise in relevant subject areas to get input on description.<sup>[14](#myfootnote14)</sup>

* Describe records in a way that supports the information-seeking needs of stakeholder communities, not just academic scholars.

  * Develop and maintain relationships with community members/stakeholders in order to learn language that the audience recognizes and uses to refer to itself.<sup>[15](#myfootnote15)</sup>

  * Consider the needs of family historians and genealogists who may not be seeking “a fact or date, but to create a larger narrative, connect with others in the past and in the present, and to find coherence in one’s own life;”<sup>[16](#myfootnote16)</sup> provide opportunities for genealogists and other researchers who may want to “give back” by contributing description or connect socially with one another.<sup>[17](#myfootnote17)</sup>

  * (Re-)describers should be empathetic towards those who may have emotional ties to people  documented in records. Be careful about language choice and center the humanity of people documented in the records.

  * Take into account potential human rights uses of records, as well as the interests of survivors of abuses. This involves avoiding the inclusion of information or linkages that could put living persons at risk, providing descriptions in languages used by stakeholder communities, and creating metadata about the intentional destruction or accidental preservation of records, which could be mobilized as evidence in human rights proceedings.<sup>[18](#myfootnote18)</sup>

* Consider the option of not naming people should they decide to withhold naming or if naming them could cause harm. For highly surveilled and dispossessed communities, visibility can be a form of violence. The harm that is inflicted on Black communities, which in many cases are human rights abuses, is not always evident to those outside of those communities.<sup>[19](#myfootnote19)</sup>

* When drafting archivist-supplied description and notes,<sup>[20](#myfootnote20)</sup> use terminology that Black people use to describe themselves, while recognizing that the Black community is not a monolith, and different people will have different and sometimes conflicting preferences. Be mindful that terminology changes over time, so description will be an iterative process.<sup>[21](#myfootnote21)</sup>

  * For living collection creators or subjects, ask them for their preference.

  * Observe and take cues from the language of current historians, writers, artists, and others who are from (or descended from), specialize in, and have working relationships with the particular communities you’re describing.<sup>[22](#myfootnote22)</sup> For older records, this means consulting with experts who are knowledgeable about specific communities existing in a certain place and point in time.

  * When consulting with community members, be mindful of individual biases; and make an effort to not solely rely on one voice or representative from a particular community. One method for gathering more representative feedback could involve a peer or community review process.<sup>[23](#myfootnote23)</sup>

  * If you ask people from marginalized communities to help with description, be respectful of their time/labor and provide compensation. Do your homework first, and don’t ask others to provide information you can easily find yourself. Pay them for their work.

* Consult alternative cataloging schemes created by the subjects of the records being described when and if they are available, and cite them in a processing note or other part of the finding aid. As noted above, Black people are not monolithic, and care should be taken when consulting alternative classification schemes to ensure that the schemes consulted truly represent and apply to the community the archivist is describing.<sup>[24](#myfootnote24)</sup>

* Make sure institution-created description is assessed by outside communities.<sup>[25](#myfootnote25)</sup>

  * Provide a feedback mechanism such as creating a highly visible “Suggest a Correction” button or comment form on online finding aids, and make it clear that you welcome this kind of feedback.

  * Provide mechanisms for users to annotate finding aids.<sup>[26](#myfootnote26)</sup>

  * Organize focus groups with community members and incorporate feedback into archival description.
 
  * For description to be assessed by outside communities, it must be discoverable. If online finding aids are difficult to locate and access, or if description exists on websites that are hard to navigate, community members may be less likely to interact with them.<sup>[27](#myfootnote27)</sup>

* Ensure that Black individuals appear in name authority files, such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF) and Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC), which may involve collaborating with external communities, especially in cases where your institution lacks relevant expertise. Acknowledge that this will involve dedicating institutional and professional time and resources to co-organizing meetings and events with community members and/or providing cataloging or name authority work services if requested by communities.

* Be mindful of how individuals are described in authority records, and educate yourself and staff on compassionate and anti-oppressive creation of such records. As one example of harmful name authority creation, one institution associated the only known related date, 1832, with an enslaved individual -- the date that the institution itself had purchased him. By using “Fl. 1832” as a distinguishing characteristic, the institution was centering that transaction as the most significant event in the individual’s life.<sup>[28](#myfootnote28)</sup> Resource Description and Access (RDA) allows for more expanded differentiation methods for names, no longer limited to use of dates. Make use of events, places, occupations, and other known signifiers that humanize rather than dehumanize Black individuals.

* Acknowledge that any efforts by PWIs to collaborate with Black communities and institutions on description projects will require explicitly “addressing institutional legacies [of racism] at [these] predominantly white institutions.”<sup>[29](#myfootnote29)</sup> Additionally, it is important to acknowledge that the dominance of whiteness and white supremacy in archives and the library field goes beyond PWIs -- and that the work of helping to address and fix this imbalance of power may not be of primary importance to communities focused on their daily survival. Before reaching out to potential collaborators, institutional partners should be able to concretely articulate how projects will benefit participating communities rather than solely co-opting the knowledge of those communities for institutional gain. Finding ways to build trust and to contribute back to the communities in ways that help sustain their survival and goals should be part of the partnership. Once potential collaborators are engaged, institutional partners must remain open to projects changing and evolving based on the expressed needs of community partners.<sup>[30](#myfootnote30)</sup>

## Auditing Legacy Description and Reparative Processing

* Revisit legacy description to provide better name access for Black people where possible, including names of subjects as well as creators of records. Acknowledging the limits of provenance-based description,<sup>[31](#myfootnote31)</sup> describe the subjects of documents about oppressed or marginalized peoples at least to the extent that you describe the creators of documents. Consider the extent to which describing a person by name is an act of affirming humanity.<sup>[32](#myfootnote32)</sup>

* At the same time, when describing living creators or subjects, consider that over-description has thepotential to put people from groups already subject to inordinate amounts of surveillance<sup>[33](#myfootnote33)</sup> at greater risk. Whenever possible, consult the person(s) implicated before including personal information<sup>[34](#myfootnote34)</sup> thatcould possibly put them at risk.

* Audit past harmful description practices and implement taxonomic reparations when appropriate.<sup>[35](#myfootnote35)</sup> This might include:

  * Devoting the necessary time, staffing, and financial resources to remediate racist descriptive practices.
  
  * Taking the time to locate and describe hidden voices and to correct past failures to respectfully describe the histories of Black communities. Following a More Product, Less Process (MPLP) or iterative processing approach, this means considering past failures of care and the possibility of uncovering hidden voices among the factors for deciding when prioritizing which collections -- or portions of collections -- should receive work above and beyond baseline processing tiers.<sup>[36](#myfootnote36)</sup>
  
  * Integrating remediation of racist language in finding aids into regular legacy description cleanup projects.

  * When replacing racist terms from archivist-supplied description, refraining from removing entirely language that would help researchers discover Black subjects in archival collections, particularly in collections that are predominantly white<sup>[37](#myfootnote37)</sup> (i.e. do not simply delete the word “negro” without using a diff erent descriptor).
 
  * Paying attention to and removing racist physical descriptions of individuals and descriptions that inappropriately assign emotions or motives to subjects.<sup>[38](#myfootnote38)</sup>
  
  * When surfacing under-described records of marginalized groups, take care to make these records discoverable without further other-izing them or tokenizing people described in the records. For example, at Princeton, the Association of Princeton Puerto Rican Alumni Records were described in a large artificial collection of subject files. Archivists removed them from this collection and created a separate finding aid<sup>[39](#myfootnote39)</sup> for the records as appropriate for an organizational records collection.
 
* When updating racist language or contextualization in finding aids, always preserve a copy of previous description so that future researchers can explore the history of the finding aid,40 as well as documentation of the rationale behind changes. Methods for doing this include:
  
  * Preserving old hard copies or PDFs of finding aids
  
  * Creating a publicly accessible collection of legacy finding aids
  
  * Making use of local tools for tracking processing documentation, which could include collection management soft ware, physical or digital collection files, version control software and commit notes, or others, as available
  
  * Provide a note and/or link in the current finding aid that indicates the existence of legacy finding aids, why they were kept, and how to access them.
